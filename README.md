# IT'S NOT CRAP. IT'S BULLSHIT! #

This is a simple app with facts as questions, either true or bullshit. 
I started it with a target of learning some new stuff about AngularJS and Spring Boot.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Get JDK 1.8
* From this point - maven should take care of the rest (node, bower, java and js dependencies)
* To run without PostgreSQL installed - run with "dev" Spring Boot profile - in-memory DB will be used as fallback.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests
* Code reviews
* Other guidelines

### Who do I talk to? ###
