# IT'S NOT CRAP. IT'S BULLSHIT! #

This is a simple app with facts as questions, either true or bullshit. 
I started it with a target of learning some new stuff about AngularJS and Spring Boot.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Get JDK 1.8
* From this point - maven should take care of the rest:
** Download back-end dependencies
** Download Node.js
** Download Bower
** Use Bower to download front-end dependencies:
*** AngularJS
*** Bootstrap
* To run without PostgreSQL installed - run with "dev" Spring Boot profile - H2 embeded DB will be used as fallback:
```
-Dspring.profiles.active=dev
```

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests
* Code reviews
* Other guidelines
