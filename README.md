# IT'S NOT CRAP. IT'S BULLSHIT! #

This is a simple app with facts as questions, either true or bullshit. 
I started it with a target of learning some new stuff about AngularJS, Spring Boot and Javaslang functional library.
After some time rewrote whole thing to use Angular (2) and moved to gradle (previously used maven) - there is a git tag right before this switch.

The app is hosted on Heroku: [bullshit-app-api](https://bullshit-app-api.herokuapp.com/)

## How do I get set up? ###

* Get JDK 1.8
* run ```gradlew bootRun``` to launch tomcat on ```localhost:8080```
* To run with PostgreSQL installed - setup environment variable JDBC_DATABASE_URL (Database URL in JDBC format). It's also a standard Heroku Java setup variable.
* To run without PostgreSQL installed - run with "dev" Spring Boot profile - H2 embeded DB will be used as fallback: ```-Dspring.profiles.active=dev```

### Swagger
