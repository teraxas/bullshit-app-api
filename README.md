# IT'S NOT CRAP. IT'S BULLSHIT! #

This is a simple app with facts as questions, either true or bullshit. 
I started it with a target of learning some new stuff about AngularJS and Spring Boot.

App is hosted on Heroku: [bullshit-app](https://bullshit-app.herokuapp.com/)

### How do I get set up? ###

* Get JDK 1.8
* Setup Maven (Script is provided)
* run ```mvn spring-boot:run``` to launch tomcat on '''localhost:8080```
* Import as Maven project to your favorite IDE (optional)
* From this point - maven should take care of the rest:
  * Download back-end dependencies
  * Download Node.js
  * Download Bower
  * Use Bower to download front-end dependencies:
    * AngularJS
    * Bootstrap
* To run with PostgreSQL installed - setup environment variable JDBC_DATABASE_URL (Database URL in JDBC format). It's also a standard Heroku Java setup variable.
* To run without PostgreSQL installed - run with "dev" Spring Boot profile - H2 embeded DB will be used as fallback:
```
-Dspring.profiles.active=dev
```

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests
* Code reviews
* Other guidelines
